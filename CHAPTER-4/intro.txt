 🚦 What is Control Flow?
 Control flow decides which code runs, when it runs, and how many times it runs.
 It's like decision-making + direction in your JavaScript program.
 If operators are the verbs, control flow is the traffic signal.
 🧱 if, else if, else
 js
 if (condition) {
 // runs if condition is true
 } else if (anotherCondition) {
 // runs if first was false, second is true
 } else {
 // runs if none are true
 }
 ✅ Example:
 js
 let marks = 78;
 if (marks >= 90) {
 console.log("A");
 } else if (marks >= 75) {
 console.log("B");
 } else {
 console.log("C");
 }
 🌀 switch-case
 Great for checking one variable against many values.

 switch (value) {
 case value1:
 // code
 break;
 case value2:
 // code
 break;
 default:
 // fallback
 }
 ✅ Example:
 js
 let fruit = "apple";
 switch (fruit) {
 case "banana":
 console.log("Yellow");
 break;
 case "apple":
 console.log("Red");
 break;
 default:
 console.log("Unknown");
 }
 🔁 Early Return Pattern
 Used in functions to exit early if some condition fails.
 js
 function checkAge(age) {
 if (age < 18) return "Denied";
 return "Allowed";
 }

 This avoids deep nesting and makes logic cleaner.
 ⚠ Common Confusions
 switch-case
 executes all cases after a match unless you 
else if
 chain works top-down — order matters
 You can use truthy/falsy values directly in 
break
 if
 🧠 Mindset
 Control flow = conditional storytelling.
 It helps your program make choices and respond differently to different inputs.
 Write readable branches. Avoid nesting too deep — use early return if needed.
 🧪 Practice Zone
 1. Student grade logic:
 js
 // Write a program that prints A, B, C, D, or F based on marks
 2. Rock-paper-scissors:
 js
 // Given player1 and player2's choice, print winner or draw
 3. Login message:
 js

 let isLoggedIn = true;
 let isAdmin = false;
 // Show different messages based on combination
 4. Weather advice:
 js
 let weather = "rainy";
 // Use switch-case to print what to wear
 5. Age checker:
 js
 // Return "Kid", "Teen", "Adult", or "Senior"
