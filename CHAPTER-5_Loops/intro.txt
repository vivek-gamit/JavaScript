 🔁Chapter 5: Loops
 (JavaScript – Learn Everything Series by Sheryians Coding School)
 🔄 Why Loops?
 Loops help us repeat code without rewriting it.
 If a task needs to be done multiple times (e.g., printing 1–10, going through an array, or
 checking each character in a string), loops are the backbone.

 🔁 
for
 Loop
 js
 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
 console.log(i);
 }
 Start from 
i = 0
 Run till 
i < 5
 Increase 
i
 each time
 🔁 
while
 Loop
 js
 let i = 0;
 while (i < 5) {
 console.log(i);
 i++;
 }
 Condition is checked before running
 🔁 
do-while
 Loop
 js
 let i = 0;
 do {
 console.log(i);
 i++;
 } while (i < 5);
 Runs at least once, even if condition is false

 ⛔ 
break
 and 
continue
 break 
: Exit loop completely
 continue 
: Skip current iteration and move to next
 js
 for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
 if (i === 3) continue;
 console.log(i);  // Skips 3
 }
 🌀 
for-of
 – Arrays & Strings
 js
 for (let char of "Sheryians") {
 console.log(char);
 }
 Works on anything iterable (arrays, strings)
 🧱 
forEach
 – Arrays
 js
 let nums = [10, 20, 30];
 nums.forEach((num) => {
 console.log(num);
 });
 Cleaner than 
for
 for arrays, but you canʼt break/return

 🧱 
for-in
 – Objects (and arrays if needed)
 js
 let user = { name: "Harsh", age: 26 };
 for (let key in user) {
 console.log(key, user[key]);
 }
 Goes over keys in objects
 ⚠ Common Confusions
 for-in
 is for objects, not arrays (may cause issues with unexpected keys)
 forEach
 can't use 
break
 or 
while
 and 
continue
 do-while
 work best when number of iterations is unknown
 🧠 Mindset
 Loops = data processor.
 Use the right loop for the job:
 for
 = best for numbers/indexes
 for-of
 = for array values
 for-in
 = for object keys
 while
 = for unpredictable conditions
 🧪 Practice Zone
 1. Print 1 to 10 using 
for
 2. Print even numbers between 1 to 20
 3. Reverse a string using loop

 4. Sum of all numbers in an array
 5. Print all characters of a name using 
for-of
 6. Print all object keys and values using 
for-in
 7. Use 
continue
 to skip a specific number
 8. Guess number game – use 
while
 to ask until correct
 9. Pattern: Print triangle using 
*
 10. Sum of even numbers in an array using 
forEach
